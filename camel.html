            <p>A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as
                "humps" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (milk and
                meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their
                desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving
                species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the
                two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now
                critically endangered.</p>
