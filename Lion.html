            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular, deep-chested body,
                short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic;
                adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184 to 208 cm (72 to 82
                in) they are larger than females at 160 to 184 cm (63 to 72 in). It is a social species, forming groups
                called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female
                lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystones
                predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the
                species typically does not.</p>
