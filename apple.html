                <P>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated
                    worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree
                    originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples
                    have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to
                    North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
                    cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
                    <br>
                    Apple trees are large if grown from seed. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by grafting onto
                    rootstocks, which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known
                    cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred
                    for various tastes and use, including cooking, eating raw and cider production.
                    Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be
                    controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was
                    sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
